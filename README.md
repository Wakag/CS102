This is our 2022 Csc1 second semster project based on the game TicTacToe. We created the application in Android studios using Java as our prefered language.

How to install:  

- Can be uploaded via USB.
- Unzip TicTacToe.zip into your Android Studio Projects and run it there.

How to Use:

Start by choosing which mode you want to play in (one player or 2 player).
The goal of the game Tic-Tac-Toe is to get all of your symbols into a 3 by 3 board in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Press the reset button if you want to quit.
